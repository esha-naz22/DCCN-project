        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A complete university campus network design implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes multiple labs (e.g., CS Lab, Mass Comm Lab, General Lab, FYP Lab, C-Labs), faculty offices, VLANs for students, faculty, and IT, inter-VLAN routing, printers, FTP servers, and wireless configuration with SSID "GIFT". The design uses subnetting based on student roll number and includes simulation-based testing.</p>
